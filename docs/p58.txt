I love to stack things into piles,/
Provoking, from observers, smiles./
I pile up coins and logs and things;/
I pile up books and chicken wings;/
I've piled up plates, toys, sand, and cups;/
I've piled up piles and piled up ups!/
I like to pile all sorts of stuff;/
Of piling I can't get enough!/
I like to pile things very high,/
To forehead-height or height of sky./
By preference I'll pile up tall,/
But will, if need requires, pile small./
Some piles, of course, are others' betters;/
