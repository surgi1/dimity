So, nothing yet in Thee is seene,
But soon as genial Heat warms thee within,
A new-born Wood of various Lines there grows;
Here buds an A, and there a B,
Here sprouts a V, and there a T,
And all the flourishing Letters stand in Rows.
    --Abraham Cowley, "Written in Juice of Lemmon".

Still, seely Paper, thou wilt think
That all this might as well be writ in Ink.
Oh no; there's sense in this, and Mysterie;
Thou now maist change thy Authors name,
And to her Hand lay noble claim;
For as She Reads, she Makes the words in Thee.
    --Abraham Cowley, "Written in Juice of Lemmon".

Oh, no; there's sense in this, and mystery—
Thou now mayst change thy author's name,
And to her hand lay noble claim;
For, as she reads, she makes, the words in thee.
