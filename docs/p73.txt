This story takes place on a certain date in the fall, when the air is sweet and dead leaves are nine deep on the ground.

A bear and a duck decide to visit a country club.

The bear drives; she likes to toot the horn.

They park in the big lot.

"Do we have reservations?" the duck asks.

"Of course we do," says the bear.

The mean, close, stingy duck says, "I forgot my wallet." He says, "I don't even have a single buck."

"That will be okay," says the bear. "It's on me."

They play the back nine of the golf course.

"What time is it?" asks the duck, who likes golf a little, but not a lot.

"It's just one."

"Your watch is not wound," the duck observes.

"The battery is dead," the bear remembers. "I forgot to charge it."

They visit the buffet, then the casino.

"Follow my lead," says the duck.

They roll the die. The bear, who breaks even, does well: she does better than the duck, who strikes out. "What a let-down!" he says, sorry for himself.

Later, in the bar, where a horn band play an old rock and roll air, the bear orders a stout, the duck a glass of punch. They drink.

"This is better than a lot of dives," says the bear.

The duck blows some bubbles in his punch. "I have to hit the head," he says.

When he returns, he notices a dove at the next table.

"What is your name?" asks the duck. "Are you single?"

"Sorry," says the dove.

"Let me get you a drink. What will you have?"

"Well ... okay. A Bloody Mary."

(The bear takes out her wallet.)

A big old buck returns to find his date flirting with the duck. "You better back away, duck."

"Nice horn," says the duck.

"These are antlers," says the buck. "Dummy."

"Be nice, Barry," says the dove.

"That's an odd name," says the duck.

"That's an odd face," says the buck.

"Can't you find some sweet little does to harass?"

"You better half hope I don't harass you," says the buck.

"Don't be mean, Barry," says the dove.

The buck -- for he can't bear to follow orders -- says, "Nice arms."

"What is that supposed to mean?" says the duck. "These are wings, you dummy."

The buck, snorting, brandishes his antlers and prepares to charge.

The dove, a pacifist, leaves.

The buck tears a table in half. The duck gives him a punch in the bottom; the bear gives him a hit in the face.

The buck picks up a glass.

"Watch out!" says the duck.

The buck wings the glass; the bear is able to duck just in time. "That's close!"

The duck arms himself with a stout club; the bear, despite her reservations, picks up a lead bar.

They buffet the buck with blows. To get away, he dives out of a window.

The window breaks; glass shatters; everyone observes him fall, one story, down to the ground, where his head strikes a rock.

Bloody bubbles well out of a deep wound.

The bear and duck flee into the park, and then, fearing a charge of assault and battery, flee the country.

Later, the duck, snorting, remembers the time when that buck dove out of the window.

But the bear, at bottom a pacifist, says, "I hope he didn't die."

Meanwhile, far away, tears roll down the face of the dove.
